API Used: : http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt3896198&apikey=989d5767

How to run: Clone the repo, open the project in android studio, sync gradle files and then run the app.

As mentioned in the assignment, I have used the following:
 1. Jetpack Compose
 2. Hilt for Dependency Injection
 3. Retrofit for network calls
 4. Coil for image loading
 5. ViewModel + Coroutines

Also,  I have added a few unit test cases as well.
